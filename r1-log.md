## Log

### R1D0
Decided to do #100DaysOfCode #100DaysOfPython, so prepped a few things.  Made a new Twitter for the purpose.
I will be going through 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021
with Dr. Angela Yu (@yu_angela on Twitter) via udemy.

I am not a new programmer, by a long shot.  I have been self-taught programming since I was about 8 years old, started with copying BASIC out of magazines onto a TI-994a.
In my life, I have been paid to code/script in pretty much everything, ironically including Python, but it has been a while.

So I am starting from scratch at day 0.  I need to get back into the world, and I need to build some current if not simple portfolio examples.  I am hereby rebooting myself, which is frankly a bigger deal than the 100 Day commitment.  I may be out of town every once in a while, I'm only going to be reasonably tough on myself about that.  The end goal is to have 100 days of reported project-oriented learning linked from this log and annotated via Twitter @de_mondegreen.

I have noticed several people reporting starting study on Day 0.  I am always learning, so I could report something for today as well, but I will start the official reports and the official "counting" work / study, tomorrow.

I am not concerned about whether this is "working on real problems" or not, as for counting toward this challenge... The real problem that I'm working on is the slow but certain unwinding of my focus and initiative over the passing years.  The real success will be to complete one round of 100 days, even if it takes more than 100 days, at the end of which having something to show for the effort (github repo, working apps and web projects, relavent Twitter posts, blog posts).
